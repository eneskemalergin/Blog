Hello all, recently I got accepted to work at Harvard Medical School as a visiting research scientist on deep learning project which is really huge for me. I was searching a way to express my feeling with my experiences but this is what I got so far. There won't be a series of blog post of each day, not because of lack of material I learn or do in a day, but lack of time to make it as well as blog post. However, I will try my best to record everything that I learn and do during my research experience into IPython notebooks and make it available at [notebook viewer.](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/)

There will be an outline where you can simply click and go to notebook viewer to read the technical side of my experience. I also would like to talk about other things but I could not, since I won't have much time to visit places, take pictures, and do goofy stuff. I know that puts me in nerd place but I really would like to succeed on this project.

> EDIT: I could not find any time to write log nowadays, if you are coming here everyday and seeing that I did nothing, I am sorry to disappoint you. The day I am writing is day 14 :( (11/18/15). I will complete the rest as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience.
