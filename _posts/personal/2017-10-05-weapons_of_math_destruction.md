[Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality-ebook/dp/B019B6VCLO/Ã‚) is a book by [Cathy O'Neil](https://twitter.com/mathbabedotorg) (also the author of the blog called [mathbabe](https://mathbabe.org/)) which I can define in 4 words: captivating, haunting, honest, and enlightening.
