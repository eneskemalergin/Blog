And for our planet, one full revolution around this mass is approximately 365 days. Today is the 1st day, and it's the time of the year for my personal re-assessment.

## Introduction
Our world revolve around the Sun, or more technically speaking all objects with mass which has magnetic link to sun revolves around the mass in the center of our solar system. And for our planet, one full revolution around this mass is approximately 365 days. Today is the 364th day, and it's the time of the year for my personal re-assessment.  

What I always been doing is planning my whole year, but it was never been writing every detail and predicting what future is holding for me, instead I was planning to draw the frame of the bigger picture. Something like this:

I have been hearing about the new year's resolutions from people around me. I never actually tried setting goals under the label of new year's resolutions, because the same people also demonstrate that they set some unachievable goals to themselves and they mock how these things are junk. I am not saying that new year's resolutions are garbage, in fact I am saying setting goals carried me where I am now. But the term "new year's resolution" does not revoke good things, always failures and regrets, because of feeds and posts like these:

New year is actually a great time to change somethings in our life. It is better to start from beginning, and when is better than the beginning of a new year. Constantly mocking about the new year's resolution is making it really hard for me to go under this label but this year I will do it. I will do this __New Year's Resolution__ thing, and I will prove that it is not that the term is cursed but the people are not taking these changes seriously.

I will take the concept and go even further, by setting goals which will help me improve my personality, such as 'listening others' ideas more' or 'less giving in to my brain or my heart in terms of control.' These resolutions are more abstract then losing weight or eating healthy, but they are more effective and beneficial in future.


As always, I believe _"first, target the problem to solve a solution"_ approach. In this situation the solution is given, I need to find the problem. __What are the weaknesses that I need to improve?__ The moment this thought dropped into my mind, I got some problems I wanted solve about myself, such as my focus issue, and velleity of things which goes fast. But after thinking deeper I realized these are caused by me not my main personality, but the personality that I am imposing myself. Then I realized that to find a problem I need to go deeper and find another problem which results the first problem I was trying to find. __This is puzzling, I know.__ Next problem I need to address comes from a maybe one of the most popular questions __"Who Really I am?"__

We are living in a society that enforces us to engrave ourselves to the several stereotypes. People who refuses to fit into these stereotypes are criticised consciously or unconsciously. To blend in to this society we are changing ourselves from what really makes us unique. Now I understand why answering this question is really hard: __"What makes you unique and special?"__  We don't really know who we are, because we are trying to be someone else, a model, a singer, a billionaire, or a hippie. :)

## Who am I

![Who Am I? ](http://energeticawakenings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/who-am-i-5.png)

It was a painful one week period journey through my heart's deepest corners to find some answers. From the far end of my heart to the summit of my brain, I was looking for the real me. I had tons of answers but when I asked my heart I saw they are not projecting the real Enes, instead they were the puppets played by me to protect myself from others. It was the first thing I realized about myself. I am very __secretive and mistrustful__ about my own identity. I cannot trust people easily, and I think I never opened myself fully to anyone, even to my mom or my sister. This could be one of my weakness or a defense mechanism, I am not really sure.

I am driven by the __sense of idealism and morality__, which helps me focus what I am really supposed to do, __helping others__.

![Helping Others](http://quotescloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/A-person-has-two-hands-One-for-helping-himself-the-other-for-helping-others.jpg)

Unintentionally I always follow a path that I can help people most. This _"Help"_ sometimes in a form of teaching what I know, mentoring, and even following a dream to be a scientist. But now I realize that what I was trying to do was helping others. I worked almost 3 years volunterly as a teaching assistant, mentor, tutor in my school and in my organization called Scholar Development Center. People always criticized and mocked me -_at least that's how I felt_- because I was working for free even when I didn't really have money. Whatever people say about it, I always feel good when I am helping other people. 2 years ago I prepared a Python Programming class in my school to teach everyone who wants to learn programming. 35 people took the class and one of them taught Python next year to girls. I felt really good and proud.

I think I can say that, __my main purpose is helping people in need in as many ways as possible__, but I prefer to find the heart of the problem which causes people need help and solve that problem. That's why I am following an academia path in biomedical research, so I can solve bigger problem which causes trouble to thousands of people.

__I am good-tempered and accommodating person__. I try to listen and understand other side as much as possible but I am not really master at this. I have __strong opinions and I would fight endlessly for an idea I believe in__.

__I am decisive and strong-willed__, If I decided to do something, I would do it as fast as possible. That's where the problem occurs, __my attention to what I wanted to do changes really fast,__ so if I could not finish the first thing I started to do before the second thing, it is not hard for me to replace them and left first thing unfinished.  

__Creativity, imagination, conviction, and sensitivity are my main tools when I solve problems__. In a result of this weird set of tools I follow a path that not everyone follows, or I create my own paths and pioneer the following parties whom will follow the path I created. Since I am really good at opening new paths and leading people through these paths, __it makes me vulnerable to arrogancy and egocentricity.__

__I have an unaccustomed way of understanding personalities__, that's why I can engage in conversation really good, and a good first impressions. I think that's why people think that I am an extraverted person, although I am not. __I am introvert who can socialize well because of my understanding of others, but I still need alone time with myself or someone I am totally opened myself.__

__I take great care of other's feelings, and I expect the same in return.__ From very early ages, I have been hurt a lot because of this. I take this personality of mine as a vulnerability, that's why __I avoid people, and I cannot trust them easily.__ That does not mean I am an asocial person, I am quite social person, but I don't give attention to people whom I don't really know and trust, except one person only. I do meet with people and be friends with them if they are honest, if they have unique personality, if they can contribute to my intellectuality, or if they share the same values with me. I know this sounds pretty irritating, who am I to decide this and act like a superior to others? But this is me, the real me.

__I am not particularly good with conflict and criticism,__ my sensitivity can do everything to evade them. The problem is that I take conflicts and criticisms as personal attacks even if you are trying to help me and I could fight back when there is no way to run away from them.

__I am passionate about many things__ such as, Biology, Star Wars, Computers and Computation, Books, Astronomy, and more. __My conviction to my passions can take me to new horizons easily however if the zeal gets our of hand, I would get exhausted, unhealthy and stressed.__ This semester there was one passion of mine which is the most recent and probably the biggest passion I had prevented me to focus on other things that I had to give my all attention to. So being passionate is not 100% helpful in terms of academic, I have to control these passions before they control me and my life.

__I am a dreamer but my dreams are not idle dreams. I prefer to take concrete steps to realize the goals of mine.__ My dreams are really big, they are huge. I plan everything according to the get my dreams as reachable as possible. Starting from early ages, I always chose and follow a path which takes me to my dreams. So far I never failed in my dreams not even once. I got all of them if they are in right time of course. I also want to be a scientist who works at international space station, this one is not yet achievable there are requirements to complete. There is a problem here like other ones, which is to lose myself in the ongoing process of achieving my goals. __I forget to take care of myself and if I got really frustrated in the middle__ I need some kind of relaxation mechanism that cools me down so I could continue my journey to the stars.

This is me in nutshell, not really comprehensive but roughly. From these and my other observations, I came up with some strengths and weaknesses:

![Strenghts and Weaknesses ](http://proffittmanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Strengths-Weaknesses-e1430915115421.jpg)


### Strengths

__Insightful__: As I mentioned earlier, I always had this unusual understanding of what is going on around me. I can understand people, what they need, what they think about me or about others. I am really good at connecting events and people, I can use these insights to deduct what happened and what might possibly happen. Because of this I don't give in to manipulation and sales tactics easily, so the discussions are rather more honest and straight forward. That's why people can find me irritating.

__Altruistic__: I am never abstain myself from taking risks when it's about others' well being. I can take action to advance an idea that I believe it will make the world a better place.

__Determined and Passionate__: Whatever the reason if I am truly passionate about a goal, I would pursue the goal with conviction and full energy, nothing can interfere. However this determination for other things that I am not really passionate about is very limited. I can easily get distracted to what I am truly passionate. For example since I learned deep learning and it's applications getting into classes and doing homework became really cumbersome for me, because I prefer to explore the possibilities in deep learning rather than going into boring classes on software development methods.

__Creative__: Creativity is really important for me, I am not talking about artistic creativity such as in art and music but the practical creativity. Always thinking differently and approaching a problem from different ways shows how creative I am. I really enjoy finding creative solutions to what/who I care about.


### Weaknesses

__Sensitive__: I am really sensitive, if someone criticizes or challenges what I believe, I can be offended and I can take my guard to fight back. Of course this does not mean that I am not going to take any criticism but I don't prefer to take it from ordinary people, but people who I am really close to. So far only 2 people can directly criticize me without really hurting me.  

__Emotional__: Because of my sensitivity and trust issues, I got a lot of ups and downs in terms of emotional state. If I trusted someone and I felt betrayed, I could not recover easily from the shock. Even I see someone who destroy an ant nest, I can get emotional and get sad.  

__Jealous__: Uuu this is very new for me. Before I get jealous about successful people but I got it over. Now I can pray for my competitors to be successful. However new kind of jealousy appeared this semester, which cripples me almost a day. Cannot think anything else if I feel jealous.

__Private and Secretive__: I am more of a representer of an idea. That's why different people who think they know me, knows me from my ideas that I represent. If you ask my classmates who is Enes, most of my classmates would answer like, Scientist or Python Enthusiast, or some other ideology that I am living with. But they won't know other things If I don't choose to show them. As I mentioned earlier, this comes from my secretive nature. I don't share unnecessary information about myself, or I simply lie about some information, to avoid being exposed a lot.

__Perfectionist__: This might sound like a good thing but it is not. It is something very frustrating to live with. During my undergraduate education, I wanted to be the best student, in every assignment, in every presentation, in every writing class, and so on. To start writing or coding is extremely hard when you cannot start the rough draft because you erase everything countless times. Why would anybody start from perfect? Perfect is what you get with effort and practice.This one is also a weakness I have been working on to overcome.

__Cause dependent__: I get so caught up in the passion of my pursuits that any of the cumbersome administrative or maintenance work that comes between me and the ideal I see on the horizon is deeply unwelcome. I like to know that I am taking concrete steps towards their goals, and if routine tasks feel like I am getting in the way, or worse yet, there is no goal at all, I will feel restless and disappointed.

__Easily Frustrated__: My passion, poor patience for routine maintenance, tendency to present myself as an ideal, and extreme privacy tend to leave me with few options for letting off steam.

__Focus Problem__: This has been a big problem for me from the early ages. I got distracted pretty easily from anything except some special things that I am really really passionate about. This one I should solve as soon as possible.

__Temperamental__: This one also bugs me a lot. When I am in the beginning of the semester, I have everything planned, projects, research, extra curricular. However at the end of the first month I realized that I replaced some projects or took more things to do which cripples my productivity, and I end up leaving some projects away.


## Reassessment of 2016

I am active on Twitter and Facebook, so I can say that I could follow up what is going on around the world and what are people's opinions about it. 2016 was a bad year for most of the people, and it was for me too. I am saying this because of what happened in my country during summer, terrorist attacks all around the world from people who uses my beautiful religion's name to foul the all Muslims picture, all the famous people who passed away especially Muhammad Ali and Carrie Fisher, and it was a bad year because I could not improve myself as much as last year.

It was not a total disaster though, I have learned deep learning and how to apply to genomic data sets, I have had a successful internship in Harvard Medical School, I have met with the love of my life, -_although she does not really like me_-, I have put together an open source online curriculum for bioinformatics, I have read 29 books in total _(13 Turkish, 15 English, 1 Japanese )_ I have created 16 repositories and 553 pushes in GitHub, I have written 12 blog posts, and I have acquired 5 certificates from Coursera and EdX.

It looks like a lot, however compared to how much I spent for nothing it is not a lot at all. This year especially after June 2016 was super hard for me. I felt the depression, the love, the loneliness, the success, the failure, the discouragement, the disappointment... After returning from Boston to Houston, I heard the news of my parents and my world turned black. But I had to study for GRE exam and focus on my applications for PhD. Every time I try to do focus study the steam of thoughts about my family invades my mind. So I started to study in crowded areas or with music turned on, which is not the best idea while studying. So GRE was a disaster and I could not put all my effort to my applications. I applied to 12 schools and honestly I am expecting maybe only 1 of them return with positive answer.

Before 2016 I always consider myself a rational person who values the time management, productivity, importance of success over everything, but I am not as logical as I thought I was. I am really emotional and I decide with my intuition and my feelings. I realized this after meeting with a girl who gave me an experience/curse of my life. She gave all the control to my heart, and now my brain cannot control anything. _(Of course it's metaphorically speaking, brain has the control over everything but the control of decision making mechanism is passed into heart )_ All those years with thinking about my spiritual and academic life, this feeling was really new for me. Around her I feel like I lost all my coolness and my intelligence and become an idiot who tries to impress her. What a primitive instinct... Of course it is far complicated than what happens in animal kingdom but male animals have more colorful appearances that they could impress the female. That's how I feel around her.

I am not even going to go into detail about my classes, total catastrophy. Lowest grade I took is B but still I could have aced all my classes easily since I knew the material before hand. All I needed was to attend the class and do the homework on time.

So overall, it was not the best year. Now what important is to decide what should I do to avoid these mistakes in year 2017 and become who I want to be.


## New Years Resolutions

![New Year New Goals ](http://innovationexcellence.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2017.jpg)

In the beginning I said I would set very specific resolutions, rather than setting general goals. Here are what I want to change about myself to improve my personality and quality of my personal life.

I shall,

- Follow up my yearly academic goals for productive year
- Becoming more rational not giving in to emotional ups and downs
- Finishing what I started before going into a new task/project
- Aim for the stars

PS: If you got this far, thank your for your patience. Now you know me more than most of my friends.
