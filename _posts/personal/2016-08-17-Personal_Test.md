Our world revolve around the Sun, or more technically speaking all objects with mass which has magnetic link to sun revolves around the mass in the center of our solar system. And for our planet, one full revolution around this mass is approximately 365 days. Today is the 364th day, and it's the time of the year for my personal re-assessment.  

What I always been doing is planning my whole year, but it was never been writing every detail and predicting what future is holding for me, instead I was planning to draw the frame of the bigger picture.
