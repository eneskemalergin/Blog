The Brain is a very efficient machine which has control over everything in our bodies and especially in terms of regulating the habit/routine mechanism, but sometimes we cannot really do what we wanted to do with our brains. In this blog post I am going to share some points and some daily routines that we can increase our ability the use our brains.

Technically brain is not a muscle, although it has some muscles. Brain has grey and white matter which have more complex functions than muscles. However training brain like muscle is possible and brain will improve under the specific schedule of intensive workout. __This ability is called plasticity of brain. (Neuroplasticity)__ After reading some [papers](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v427/n6972/abs/427311a.html) on Neuroplasticity and brains ability change itself, I wanted to try it to myself. Involuntarily all of us are somehow changing our brains from the very beginning until the end. But I wanted to change it in a very good way so I could use my brain more efficiently. After an extensive research on training brain, increasing processing power, increasing memory power, and other related topics; I came up with 6 subject which combines most beneficial techniques and habits for training our brains.
