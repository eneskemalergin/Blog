Outline of the Day:
---

- _Arriving the Lab @ 9:30am_
- _Session 1 @ 9:45am_
  - TensorFlow Tutorial Part 2
  - Jupyter iTorch kernel problem  
- _Session 2 @ 1:00pm_
  - Started Modeling with TensorFlow
- _Leaving the Lab @ 4:30pm_

### Session 1

Today we did not have a meeting in the morning, since our supervisor was not in the lab, instead we continue our studies. I am focusing on programming part more so I am learning TensorFlow. In this session I did finish TensorFlow tutorial part 2, which is available at my [blog](http://eneskemalergin.github.io//blog/TensorFlow_Tutorial_2/). I have learned artificial neural network, deep neural network, and convolutional neural network implementations in TensorFlow. I had some previous knowledge about them, which made it easier for  me to understand the general concepts of those topic I covered.

Another thing kept me in session 1 was a problem about Jupyter notebook. I use iTorch kernel within Jupyter, which is quite a productive way for writing code. Somehow, when I tried to open a new iTorch notebook, it threw an error, saying given path is not found. I spend around half an hour but could not solve the problem, and passed this issue for another time.

### Session 2

In second session, I start converting our old model in Torch7 to TensorFlow.

I had to leave the lab early today, because I get really tired earlier then usual.
