        <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Healthy-Habit-Revolution-Blueprint-Minutes-ebook/dp/B00RIONNPU"><strong>The Healthy Habit Revolution</strong></a> by Derek Doepker, is a laconic guide to the Habit development. Even though the book is designed to give reader 21 days to read, I read through it like I read all Personal Development book, while taking notes.</p>

<h3 id="day-1-why-you-cant-change-habits-until-you-change-this-first"><strong>Day 1: Why You Can’t Change Habits Until You Change This First:</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>We typically only see, and therefore recognize, the end result and not the mundane things that were behind achieving it.</li>
  <li>In today’s society a person is more likely to be congratulated for losing 50 pounds rather than eating salad everyday to achieve 50 pound weight loss.</li>
  <li>We need to enjoy the process of practicing(there is a really nice book I’ve read some time ago called Practicing Mind.)</li>
  <li>Another reason is to have hard time starting a healthy habit is a fear of failure.</li>
  <li>The focusing on only results will distract you, which ultimately keep you away from achieving the result.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-2-the-seed-of-transformation"><strong>Day 2: The Seed of Transformation:</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>The most natural way to feel the need of habit change happens when your identity changes a little (Expand here in the blog post)</li>
  <li>To believe that change is possible for oneself is also a must</li>
  <li>Outside feelings like anger, which might lead to “I will prove all of you wrong” idea, could be a good push</li>
  <li>Changing the identity, will change your behaviors, and vice-verse.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h3 id="day-3-how-your-habits-work"><strong>Day 3: How Your Habits Work:</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Habit development (as a cycle) consists of 3 steps, which is introduced in Charles Duhigg’s The Power of Habit:
    <ul>
      <li>The Cue, what triggers the habit
        <ul>
          <li>The Routine, habitual behavior</li>
          <li>The reward, pleasure get, that makes you want to repeat the habit</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Behavior can have different emotional impacts on different people.</li>
  <li>There are six human needs, which are really important because they are the reason we feel rewarded by something emotional.
    <ul>
      <li>Certainty (comfort)</li>
      <li>Variety (excitement, entertainment)</li>
      <li>Connection</li>
      <li>Significance</li>
      <li>Growth</li>
      <li>Contribution</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Old/Bad habits are easy to remove because they hit one of the 6 needs mentioned above.</li>
  <li>Our target is to replace them with healthier ones, using those 6 needs. New habits should be stable if not, the old habits will be replaced with another bad habit.</li>
  <li>The habits stay programmed in the brain, it’s near impossible to get rid of a bad habit entirely, but replace it with a better/healthier alternative habit that meets the same emotional need is possible.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h3 id="day-4-what-will-upgrade-your-life"><strong>Day 4: What Will Upgrade Your Life?:</strong></h3>

  <li>Getting a perfect plan is not necessary, also most of the time impossible.</li>
  <li>Find a first step to start acting, that’s all what it takes.</li>
  <li>Start with a small action that you can do every day.</li>
  <li>In order to develop a habit, find an extremely small target to hit each day.</li>
  <li>Momentum creates Motivation.</li>
  <li>“Get obsessed with consistency.”  Amir Siddiqui</li>
  <li>You often won’t feel motivated until after you get started. Momentum creates motivation.</li>
</ul>

 </li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p> </p>

  <li>To make your habits subconscious choice, there is a genius way to make the subconscious, let’s say we want to be able to wake up early with one alarm only. When you fully awake you practice in bed, just close your eyes and put your alarm for 5 min later, when the alarm goes off take a deep breath and get up out of the bed quickly. Repeating this in different days for some time will develop a subconscious habit of waking up faster and better.</li>

  <li>When you invest/sacrifice time, money, and/or emotions into something, that is more likely that you will stick to it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="revealing-the-hidden-lessons"><strong>Revealing the Hidden Lessons</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Everyone of has have an inner critic, called and ego(?), tells you that you are not good enough, comparing yourself to others.</li>
  <li>Getting rid of this inner critic is not possible, but recognizing who that is will help you overcome the negative motivation.</li>
  <li>Growth is one of the six human needs and it requires confronting and overcoming what you are not comfortable with, which is the exact same situation that you find yourself into when you overcome the voice of ego.</li>
  <li>
    <p>“Everything can either serve or enslave you depending on how you respond to it.” Derek Doepker
 </p>
  </li>
  <li>Successful people start moving before seeing the entire path.</li>
  <li>We try to see the entire path before even start moving, which makes us stay where we are because to see the entire path
is not possible. Even if you think you see the entire path, it will change along the way.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Single compromise can create a “what-the-hell” effect (Janet Polivy)</li>
  <li>If you let one compromise that will create more, and you will end up saying, “I’ve already messed up my diet today, so I’ll just indulge and start fresh tomorrow.”</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Being flexible is not always bad though. Good habits can be destructive when you are so strict about it, that it my destroy other things in your life.</li>
</ul>
