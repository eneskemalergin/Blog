I am senior undergrad student at North American University. My major is computer science and my passion is biology, so I am focusing on the intersection between computer science and biology.

I worked on several research projects, and open source projects. In each project I expanded my skills and understanding of biological concepts.  

I am  very active on social activities, since I am the parliamentarian of Student Government in my school since 2014. I am also founder and director of Future Leaders Club at NAU since 2015. I am member of ISCB and ACM organizations.
