Hi there,

I am a bioinformatics scientist with esoteric solutions to the problems in field of biology using power of computers and artificial intelligence. I am currently working towards my Masters + PhD in Bioinformatics at University of British Columbia, Canada. I am graduate student at Lange Lab at BC Children's Hospital Research Center working on Cancer Proteomics.

There are tons of different things that excites me but biggest two is biology and computer science, that's why I choose to go forward with my education on Bioinformatics field.

I write mostly about what I am interested currently that's why you can find a lot of different areas. If you want to check something specific check the tags tab. This blog is started as pure technical blog with only relevant posts then I wanted to include some other domains as well such as book summary and language learning articles.
